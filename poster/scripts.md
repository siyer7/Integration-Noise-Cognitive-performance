## Introduction

## Methods
In our experiment, subjects have to decide whether the average orientation
of a group of gabor patches is clockwise or counter-clockwise, w.r.t the 
horizontal axis. We increase the encoding noise by decreasing the contrast
in the patches. We increase the integration noise by increasing the 
variability of orientations across the patches. To recap, the low contrast
condition presents high encoding noise, and the high variability condition
presents high integration noise. A 3rd baseline condition serves as a 
control. To measure subjects’ confidence, we study their reliance on a hint
that we provide, and also ask them to explicitly report their confidence.


# Results

## Lower accuracy in 'high variability'
We want to know whether our stimulus manipulation did in fact add noise, 
that is make the task more difficult. We compared subjects’ accuracy across
the different conditions and found that, on average, performance was highest
in the ‘baseline’ and lowest in ‘high variance’. However, there are 
individual differences in this trend. Some subjects (like subject 4), 
performed almost as well in ‘low contrast’ as in ‘baseline’. The inline 
plot shows the difference in accuracy between ‘low contrast’ and ‘high 
variability’. Notice that almost all subjects performed better in ‘low 
contrast’ than in ‘high variability’.

## Lower Cue Reliance in 'high variability'
In the experiment, we provided an informative cue on half the trials. We 
assume subjects will rely more on the cue if they are less confident, so our
hypothesis predicts that subjects will be less influenced by the cue in the
‘high variability condition’.
To calculate how much subjects relied on the cue, we fit psychometric curves
to subjects’ responses for each of the cues presented in each condition. 
Psychometric curves model how a subject’s response changes as a function of
the signal in the stimulus (in our case, as the average orientation moves
away from 0, it becomes easier to determine the correct answer). Looking at
the example provided, we see that this subject’s responses were indeed 
influenced by the cue, as seen by the shift in curves in the presence of 
cues. To quantify this, we calculated the distance between these curves.
We found that, on average, subjects were indeed less influenced by the cue
in the ‘high variance condition’. Individual subjects showed some differences.
Looking at the inline plot which shows the difference in reliance between
the ‘low contrast’ and ‘high variance’ conditions, we see that no subjects
were more reliant on cues in the ‘high variability’ condition, giving us 
weak evidence that people are less able to account for integration noise
in their confidence.

## Similar confidence-accuracy alignment in ‘high variability’ and ‘low contrast’

## Discussion
Overall, we found that subjects, on average, rely about the same or less
on cues in the ‘high variability’ condition, despite having similar or
worse accuracy, giving us weak evidence that people cannot account for
integration noise in their confidence. However, analysis of the explicit
confidence measure found mixed results. On average, subjects did not have
better aligned confidence in the ‘low contrast’ condition. Thus we did 
not successfully replicate the target paper.
Extending this work by looking at individual subjects, we see more mixed
effects. Some subjects were clearly less reliant on cues in the high 
variance condition, and some subjects clearly had better aligned confidence
in ‘low contrast’, as predicted by our hypothesis. However, some subjects
show an opposite trend, wherein they had better aligned confidence in the
‘high variance’ condition, the opposite of what we predict.
One of the biggest limitations of our study was that subjects’ accuracies
were not the same in the two experimental conditions. We expect that, in
general, subjects will be more confident if they are performing better.
This means that we cannot tease apart smaller confidence from worse 
performance. To resolve this, we would repeat the experiment using a
staircase method, which will ensure that each subject is performing with
the same accuracy in the experimental conditions. Furthermore, subjects
testing was cut short due to COVID-19, so the statistical power of our
experiment is lower than we anticipated.

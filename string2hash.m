function hash=string2hash(str,type)
% This function generates a hash value from a text string
%
% hash=string2hash(str,type);
%
% inputs,
%   str : The text string, or array with text strings.
% outputs,
%   hash : The hash value, integer value between 0 and 2^32-1
%   type : Type of has 'djb2' (default) or 'sdbm'
%
% From c-code on : http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html 
%
% djb2
%  this algorithm was first reported by dan bernstein many years ago 
%  in comp.lang.c
%
% sdbm
%  this algorithm was created for sdbm (a public-domain reimplementation of
%  ndbm) database library. it was found to do well in scrambling bits, 
%  causing better distribution of the keys and fewer splits. it also happens
%  to be a good general hashing function with good distribution.
%
% example,
%
%  hash=string2hash('hello world');
%  disp(hash);
